# 8085_codes

Hi all,
My name is Madhan kumar, I have done this C programming project as a part of the ECEN academy under the guidance of Balaji seshadree.

This project contains totally two C programming projects (8085 assembler and 8085 simulator). 
1. If your objective is only to convert the Assembly code to machine code means run the 8085 assembler program.
2. If your objective is to simulate the entire assembly code and find the final result means run the 8085 simulator program.

In both the files some processor dependedent instructions like RST 3.5, 7.5 are not get implemented, those details are told in the code itself through the printf statements or through the comment lines. So use accordingly.

Thank you.
